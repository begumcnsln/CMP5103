I'm on the first camping trip with my five children.\", \"Wow, that's amazing. My parents took me camping when I was young. Now we going hiking every other weekend. What do you plan on doing?\", \"That sounds like so much fun!  I hope we get to hike some.  I have my four month old baby with us which is exciting.  I'm worried I didn't bring enough water for his bottles, though.\", \"Grilling is so much fun!  We left our grill at home so we can't really do that.  I will trade you some food for some water if you would like?\", \"I'm looking forward to this camping trip now knowing that we will have enough firewood to lastüôÇ\", \"Me too. Now that I have everything I really wanted it will be a blast. Have fun maybe I'll see you out there.\", 'Awe!  We have a dog as well, I love dogs!!  How about if you get 1 package of food, 1 water and 2 firewood?  Would that be sufficient for you?', 'Hi, this is my first time camping and I want to make sure I have enough stuff.  I would like three food, three firewood, and two water.  What do you think?', 'I have been camping a few times and pretty much know what I need to be comfortable and healthy.  Warmth and hydration are important for me.  So, I am thinking 2 firewood, 2 water and 0 food.', 'Great, thanks for understanding and working with me....and enjoy your first time campingüôÇ', 'Hello, how are you today?', 'hello, I am good, I am very excited about this trip. how are you?', 'i am great, super excited about camping as well, are there any supplies that you really need?', 'Hey, nice getting to interact with you. I would like to have additional packages of firewood and water', 'Thank you. Have a nice day ahead!', 'Thank you. Have a nice day ahead too!', 'Hello. How are you?', 'Great and yourself? Ready for this camping trip and take a break from modern civilization?', \"I'm doing well. Yes. This camping trip is badly needed!\", 'Indeed we have planned to do a lot of hiking and seeing the nature that is giving to us by god it will be a great wonderful time to serve with others and deepen our faith in the lord savior ', \"Awesome. I couldn't agree more. I feel that camping and hiking are both such spiritual experiences. It's such a perfect time to connect with our lord and savior. I love serving others as well.üôÇ\", 'Thanks for your understanding well I think if possible then to meet the situation then how bout 3 food and 2 water then you get all the wood ? That way you can have awesome campfires lasting through the night, we will be going to sleep extra early to wake up very early so we do not need all that wood, as much as we need food to replenish our energy and be ready for another day of long walks to see as much as we can from nature üôÇ', \"I agree with you that campfires are awesome and I do find them to be be quite useful. I'm not as early of a riser as you are unfortunately! üôÇ I'm willing to accept your offer on food as long as you could please consider my needs for water. I am a very active hiker. While I don't need much food for my hikes I do require a lot of water. I once went on a hiking trip when I was new to the activity and ran out of water. I got lost and almost dehydrated! Ever since then it's been very important to me to have as much water as possible. What would it take in order for me to get as much water as possible keeping in mind that I'm willing to give you 3 food. \", 'Thank you for the food and I understand we do have to think about water being by far the most important thing in life since it bascially is right üôÇ and well how about then we go do two waters for you and one wood then so then we can have that wood for just in case and we can all be happy ?? thanks for your understanding', \"Yes. Water is the most important thing in life. Thank you for offering me two waters and one wood. However, this would mean that you would be receiving 3 food, 1 water, and 2 wood. That seems too unbalanced to me. It's important for me to also let you know that wood is very crucial for me. When I was a newbie I didn't bring any wood because I figured I'm fine since I'm not scared of the dark. That night a bear snuck on me when I was sleeping. Thankfully I was able to scare it away with noise. However, ever since then I've brought a lot of wood with me so no bears can sneak up on me. I would like to counter your offer with 3 waters, 2 wood, and 0 food. This means you get 1 wood and 3 food. Does this offer work for you?\", 'Hello! how are you doing? are you excited to go camping', 'Yep! Been closed up too long with this Covid-19 stuff.üò°Wish it would like the Prez sez \"go away\"', \"Yeah, it's very sad these days\", \"Then I got here and noticed I didn't pack my cooking sterno and critters go into some of my food‚òπÔ∏èKinda puts a damper on the trip.\", 'Yeah, that should work. I brought plenty of water and the critters left that alone. You planning to go out on the trails at all?', 'I do have a little hike planned, so the water comes in handy. I am more excited to relax and fish', 'Well I want to go run the trail, but like to check it out first. Perhaps we could walk one together. perhaps in a couple moments we could fix the supply situation .', 'Yeah, that would be fun.

Hope you have a good trip!', 'Hello, what a great time of year to go camping.', \"Yes I can't wait! So sick of being stuck at home. üôÇ\", 'It will be nice to get out and explore the great outdoors, even if it is super hot!', 'I agree. What supplies could you use more of?', \"Food of course, always snack more when relaxing.  Agree on the hiking.  Out in the woods, we won't have to wear masks!\", \"Well we don't want to make all the bears sick though haha. Okay so let's try this... one of us gets 2 waters with 1 firewood and 1 food. I think that's as close as we'll get to equal. You can choose.\", \"awe, that's true,  Now I fell bad for the bears.  I'll take 2 waters and 1 food, you can have all the firewood.\", 'Okay that sounds great. Have fun!', 'Hey, how are you?', \"Hello, i'm good.\", 'How are you preparing yourself to the camping trip?', 'I am trying to gather supplies for the trip. What about you?', 'I am also checking my list and updating it. How is your progress going?', \"Its good! I am looking forward to the activites i'll be doing, such as campfires.\", \"Hey, that's great. Good to hear definitely. I am also looking forward to build some campfires and enjoy some s'mores!\", 'Okay! Great! Nice chatting with you! üôÇ', 'Sure, have a nice trip!', \"Hey there! I'm assuming you enjoy going camping?\", 'Yes I do, I am going this weekend. Are you going camping too?', 'Same! I try to go every other weekend.', 'Oh cool. What supplies do you prefer to take the most of?', 'I do a lot of hiking mostly, love to take scenic photos. I usually carry food and water supplies?', 'Me too. I am not good at hunting or fishing. So I generally try to take extra food', \"Haha I suck at those activities as well. I don't usually don't eat a lot, so I'm happy to exchange some food supplies for water supplies. \", 'hello, how are the preparations coming along?', \"Hi There, I'm doing okay with my preparations but I am worried that I don't have enough food or water for the next few days.\", 'great. have a lovely trip', 'Thanks. Have a safe trip as well.', 'Hello, how is your camping trip going?', \"Hi there.  Hoping it'll be good, and yours as well.  I was hoping we could negotiate so I could get this extra water - I was planning on this being a hiking trip and it's pretty warm and humid out, so I imagine I'll need it.\", \"That's a little tough for me but if we can come to an agreement where I get 2 of the food, I'd be willing to play ball.  We both deserve a good camping trip, after all.\", \"That's true. We both deserve a good trip. Why do you need more food?\", 'We should be able to trade soon. I hope you have a great trip!', 'You too!  Great birdwatching this season.', 'Hello, how are you?', \"I'm fine, let's talk about how we can come to a fair deal.\", \"I appreciate your generosity üôÇ I think that bringing your axe would be a great idea! Also be sure to pack warm clothes and extra blankets! I'm sure we will both be fine\", 'You are welcome! üôÇ I am happy that we reached an agreement! Did you happen to see any dry looking trees on along your way?', 'I am also happy we reached an agreement so easily! You are a great partner for compromising! Honestly, I am not sure how to tell if the trees look dry but I would definitely help you go look for some. I will submit our original deal so we can get on with campingüôÇüôÇ', 'Thank you! Stay safe out there! If you need anything else, let me know.', 'You as well! Have fun!', 'Hey, how you are today?', 'Doing good. How are you today?', \"I'm good as well, trying to plan my camping trip for the weekend. Do you enjoy camping?\", \"I do but it's hotter than I expected. Probably gonna drink a lot of water.\", 'Hello partner  How are you today?', \"Oh, I'm a bit ill, fever, chills.\", 'SO do IüòÆ!!!  That is not good.', \"No it's not.  Since my fever is very high and my chills are very bad I'd appreciate you letting me have 2 firewoods and in exchange you could have all the extra food.\", 'You are welcome.  We both want to have as good an experience and outcome as possible!', 'Hello, how are you doing?', 'I‚Äôm doing fine. How about you?', \"I'm doing well. I was hoping I could have the extra firewood because my group decided to camp for a few extra days and want to make sure we have enough\", 'How many of you are on the camping grounds?', \"It's just my family. There are 6 of us total\", 'Wow. I‚Äôm alone here. I could use an extra food and water. ', 'Hi there! How are you today?', 'Good!  How are you?', \"I'm doing well! Almost ready for my camping trip. Need some more supplies though.\", \"I couldn't live well with myself if I would let you die. You can have the two waters and 2 firewoods.

Well, what can you give me or we come to a deal on? üôÇ\", 'It was good working with you! üôÇ', 'Hey!üôÇ How are you? What were your plans for the weekend?', \"Hi. I'm doing great. How are you? I'm planning on going camping.üôÇ\", \"I'm great! Me too! did you have any specific plans? I wanted to make an extra fire to cook with and cook a nice meal. \", 'That sounds great! I hope you have a great camping trip!üôÇ', 'Thanks. I hope you do too!üôÇ', \"I like to have a lot of food to keep my energy up, but I might need some firewood to cook that food. I can't wait for my camping trip.üôÇ\", 'I love camping also!  Yes, I can see how you would need firewood if you want to cook your food.  So, food is more important to you than water?', 'That sounds great. I probably need to go on a diet, but I like my food to much. LOL', 'Well, I am pre-diabetic, so I had to do it for my health. I love food, too...especially sugar!  üôÇüôÇ', \"Well, I don't know.  I think I would like more water than firewood, but yes less food than water.

I am bringing my daughter and her girl scout troop. I am the co leader.', 'Oh that', 'Sorry, I sent my last message inadvertently. I meant to say that that sounds great! Yes, I can understand the need for extra water for the hike. With the size of my family, I could use a bit of extra food for our trip.', 'That is a very fair deal.

I am so looking forward to this camp out. My daughter just called and said she is going to come and bring some of her firiends. üôÇ', 'Hello! That sounds pretty reasonable to me. I was going out with a bunch of my buddies. We like to hike a lot in the sun, so we need lots of water.

I'm hoping for two food items and one water.  I'm diabetic so if my blood sugar drops, I may need the extra carbs.  And water because water is important! üôÇ \", \"Ooh, I didn't think of that!  I'm not a huge fan of fire but I'm even less a fan of bugs.  I'm good with two in that case.  I think we still have to meet the 10 message minimum before we can submit a deal.  So how's your day going?\", 'So far, so good but it is too hot outside to enjoy. I have been watering the garden and trying to convince my dog to come out and play but she is not interested.', \"Lol, it's hot here too!  We are always in the 110-118 degrees out in the desert.  What kind of dog do you have?\", 'She is a Corgi with a fluffy coat so she is not a big fan of the heat. I guess you get a dry heat near the desert. We have a lot of humidity which is oppressive.

Are you ready for our camping trip?', 'I am ready to go camping. I understand there might be some disagreement around the additional supplies we each can choose from?', 'It looks like we have to continue this conversation beyond a certain point before we come to a deal, so - what is your most cherished camping memory?', 'My most cherished camping memory is of the camping trips that the church I used to go to planned.  One memory is when my son was driving a boat and was doing circles.  Somehow, a wave came over the front of the boat and soaked a friend of ours.', 'Ha! That sounds wonderful.

Would you be willing to give me two packages of firewood for a package of food?', \"I enjoy camping as well. However, my campsite seems to be a bit chilly at night.

Are you excited about this camping trip? ', 'yes, I am', \"I could definitely use the time away from society.  What's your favorite part of camping? \", 'i love to eat', \"Oh yeah, I make a mean smore, myself.  My favorite part of the experience is the long walks through nature.

At least, I won't need firewood, because it will be so hot. I'm very worried about the water situation though. It's just going to be me out there and the only fresh water is at the base of the canyon, and that's a really long and dangerous hike down for one person.\", 'hello. so what are you thinking about this whole situation?', 'Hey, I think that this is nice, we get to go camping and get extra stuff.

I too am looking forward to this trip.  Definitely need to decompress. ', \"Sounds like it'll be great for both of us.  Is there anything extra you need?\", 'Hahaha, once you hear my singing you might hope the opposite.  I can do that with the firewood and water, but I really would prefer two of the remaining foods.

I am hoping we can find something amicable with these additional resources.', \"I'm excited too üôÇ. Things have been stressful lately.

Also, there's only one stream in the area and it's really far from our campsite, so it would be super inconvenient to have to hike there everyday to refill our canteens.

How about you?', 'Haha yup I had a feeling about that one. ;-) Yeah my wife has a bunch of crazy hikes planned so water is a must here too. What else?', 'Oh cool. What supplies do you prefer to take the most of?', 'Tell me, how stocked up are you on food and firewood?', \"That's true. We both deserve a good trip. Why do you need more food?\", 'Hello! What camping supplies are you looking for the most?', 'Hello! I would like more packages of food the most. What are you looking for?', 'Which supplies do you need?', 'Let me think about it. What supplies do you need?', 'Okay, can I have the 2 waters and 2 firewood then? I will give you all of the food, and 1 of the water. Do you need any firewood at all?', 'Well, let me think on that.  Why do you need so much water for a starter?', 'Hmm.  And why do you need so much food?', 'Hmmm.  And the firewood?', \"I'm great! Me too! did you have any specific plans? I wanted to make an extra fire to cook with and cook a nice meal. \", 'What are your preferences?  I always love having a big fire at night when I am camping and I do think water is more important than food.', 'I love camping also!  Yes, I can see how you would need firewood if you want to cook your food.  So, food is more important to you than water?', 'Yes, I will need a little water to wash that food down with though. Are you going to be needing a lot of water?', 'Oh, that does change things a lot. Diabetes is a hard disease to have to deal with. So you want more firewood than water? And less food than water?', 'yes good, what you want?', 'Hello. üôÇ What item did you need a little extra of?', 'Too true! Anyways, what is the item that you prefer the most for this camping adventure? üôÇ', 'Firewood, how about you?', 'i hope we can come to a compromise üôÇ, what is another priority of yours besides the wood?', 'Hello! Which item do you need the most?', 'Hello fellow camper! I am interested to know your preference in items?', \"Hello! Yes I'm excited for the trip. üôÇ My most important is food. How about you?\", 'I am excited too. I really need food too. What other item is priority for you?', \"Haha well we'll be seeing a lot of each other then. Is water your number one or two priority?\", 'No close. 2 food 1 water 1 firewood for one of us. The other gets 1 food 2 water 2 firewood. Food is your number one correct?', 'What is it that you need?', 'OK, but first tell me why you need extra food', \"Hi there! Well first I was wondering what item you think you'd like or need the most?\", 'Thanks!üôÇ Do you need any water packages?', 'Do you have any preferences in regards to the firewood, food, and water? I would like us both to get what we need.', 'Hmm I will have to think about this offer. How do you feel about the water packages?', 'Likewise! What are you in need of', 'Ah, okay, I could use some of that too! Which one do you need most?', 'water. How about you?', 'What is your priority item to get the division started?', 'yes. I am yet to know your priority. Which I guess should be either water or firewood', 'I may be able to do something with regards to food. Do you have enough water?', 'I have more water than I need. How is your water supply?', 'sure i can do that, what about the food then? how much food would you need for the tip?  can you hunt where you are going?', 'Do you need extra firewood to cook the fish? I have a bunch.', \"Ah, so you want some extra water too? I have a lot of lemonade mix for the kids so I'll need water for them.\", 'do you have a particular item preference?', 'Hello, I will start out by saying that I would like to have 3 water because I do not have a nearby water source. What is your situation?', 'How much firewood and food do you think you need? ', 'How about water? do you need? I can offer 2 of these for 1 pack of food', 'what is priority pls tell me', 'I see. Which resource do you desire most?', 'What sort of extra supplies are you looking for?', 'That sounds great! What do you prefer with the additional packages for camping?', \"Let's see what we are both thinking and negotiate from there. What are your first thoughts on the additional camping packages?\", 'I need all the food packing and some basic needs for the camping, may I know about your first though on which you need additional package?', 'Do you have a preference between food and water?', 'How are you on food? ', \"So tell me, which is most important to you? What can't you live without?\", \"Of course. So, what about food? I will definitely need the food. I have a big family, and we all need to eat. I can't have people starving. Can I take all of the food?\", 'Wonderful. And what about the firewood? I would like 2 firewood, and I can give you 1 firewood. Will you accept that?', 'I am doing well so far. üôÇ What items are of preference for you today?', 'I get that and understand completely. I have a large number of mouths to feed making the food a necessity or all the firewood to cook whatever we hunt. How many you have?', 'Great! What extra supplies would you like to bring?', 'I am good, thank you.  What are your preferences? I really need the extra food packages.  We are doing a lot of hiking and mountain biking and there are no grocery stores for at least 50 miles.üôÇ', 'Hi! What sort of packages are you looking for today?', 'Oh we have similar priorities üôÇI am also interested in getting firewood, because I have a condition that makes me very cold, colder than the average person, so I need to make sure I have enough for the trip. Why do you want food', 'That make sense. I need firewood though too because I have an autoimmune disease. When it flares up - when it gets too cold - I get very sick and have to go to the hospital. I need to make sure I have enough for the trip as well. I need food to keep my metabolism up so I can make sure my disease stays in check. Why do you want food?', 'Could you tell me about why you want water? ', \"Haha, yeah I can't wait to go. I really need lots of food and a bit of firewood. What do you need?\", \"Hi there.. we're looking forward to this camping trip.. hope you are, too!  Is there anything in particular you guys need / want out of the extra stockpile we've got?\", 'Hello! Which item do you need the most?', \"Well we actually really NEED all three items.. but I know you might, too - so I want to make a deal that's fair for you.. is there anything in particular your family needs for the trip?\", 'Well, there has to be an item that you need the most. If you tell me what you need the most, we can try to make a deal around it.', 'Do you prefer food or water more?', 'Interesting , because my group feels the same way though. How does your group feel about water though?', \"Same! I'm a little worried about some of my supplies though. What about you?\", 'Likewise! What are you most in need of?', \"Well, I'm camping up on a snowy mountain and I gave some of my food away to hikers who were passing me and were very tired and hungry, so I'd really like to get some more food. Firewood would be useful too, although I do have a thick coat and a sleeping bag. I plan on melting the snow to get water, so I don't think I'll need that too much. And you?\", 'How many of each extra package are you thinking you need?', 'I would prefer to take all of the firewood, split the food, and you could have all of the water.  What do you need the most?', \"Is your first priority the water?  I'm definitely willing to split up by what is most important to us both.\", 'I can definitely agree to that.  What was your second preference?  Water was my third.', 'Yeah, I want to make sure i am prepared. What do you think are the bests options?', 'Hello, what is your preference for supplies?  I would prefer to have as much extra firewood as possible, but am relatively indifferent to the rest.', 'I already have a good supply of fresh water from the lake I will be camping by, and can hunt for some food but not all.  What are you in need of?', 'Same here haha. Is water your lowest priority item too?', 'How much food do you need?', 'How are you with your water supply?', \"That's awesome! And oh no! I have a medium amount of food so we can work that out! How are you doing on water?\", 'May I ask how many are going camping with you, i would agree, but the needs of children are different than adults. I will need at least 1 food, to ensure I have enough for the kids. ', 'Why do you need all 3 firewoods?', \"I am also going camping! What do you think you're going to need the most of? What are your preferences?\", \"We can do the 3 for 3 trade.  That works perfectly!  Its' going to be cold at night where I'm going.  What's it like where you're heading?\", \"I am good, let's plan our camping trips. I am diabetes, so water is very important to me. what about you?\", 'what is the next thing you need the most/?', \"Yes, that's the plan. By the way, what do you need all that food for? You didn't say. I'm just curious.\", 'hello, me too. what is most valued to you?', \"I just want to make sure that I get a lot of firewood. It's going to be freezing cold on my trip, and I need to make sure I can stay warm. What's most valued to you?\", \"Okay. And what about water? I'd like at least 1 water. I'm going to do a lot of hiking and need to stay hydrated.\", 'Hello. Is there a reason you prefer more water and firewood to food?', 'I get cold very easily and also get thirsty a lot. What are your preferences?', 'That might work. What reasons do you have for needing those?', 'I understand that, but walking away with the most food and the most water would essentially leave me for dead lol. Do you prefer water or food? ', 'Great. If you mainly doing picnics do you want 3 Food?   I could use the the supplies.  üôÇ', 'Pretty good! I am excited about going camping though. When we split this, what do you need the most?', 'We are all about the food over here! what about you?', 'What are your preference what would you need most?', 'I need to keep the fire burning so i need firewood most. What about you?', 'sure what other preferences would you like ', 'What do you need most when camping? I hate splitting wood, so  I need firewood', \"You aren't very talkative are you? What preferences do you have for packages?üòÆüòÆüòÆ\", \"I'm looking forward to my camping trip! What are you trying to collect for your trip?\", 'Me too! It will be great to finally get out of town for a few days. I mostly need more firewood to keep the wife nice and toasty. How about you?', 'Ha what a surprise! ;-) What do you need second most?', 'I need food to feed all my friends that are coming up. how about you?', 'Food is the item of greatest value to you?', 'It is! What do you think?', 'The item of greatest value to me is WATER. Before thinking about an offer I need to know what your priorities are and you need to know mine in order to conclude something fair for both of you.', 'What is the least valuable item for you?', 'Hi, I brought some water with me. How much do you need? ', \"That doesn't work for me, May I ask why do you need two packages of food?\", 'Hi fellow camper! What are your needs for the extra provisions.', 'I think I would be able to make that work. What are you looking forward to while camping? ', 'Mainly cooking because I love to eat. It will be fun this time because I am leaving the kids at home. I also love swimming if we can find a river or big stream. How about you?', 'Hi, I really need water to stay hydrated during my camping trip because my food supplies are low. Do you have any to spare?', 'Is there anything that you might need? ', 'I would be interested in firewood.  Can I ask you, what are your primary concerns on this trip?', 'Do you have food? I have been trying to hunt but have not really found any animals nearby to hunt.', 'Which item do you prefer the most?', 'Okay, maybe we can split the water and then divy up the rest. What else are you interested in?', 'Same here.  It looks like we both can use some water and snacks.  Do you have any preferences of how much you will need?  I was hoping to get 2 or 3 waters and 1 or 2 foods?', 'Sending good luck your way! Any items in particular you need for your trip?', 'Well, food is high on my to do list only because I have a big family and we all know how they eat..... Wood well, I can find that along the way if necessary, and same as water so both of those are fairly low on my list... you?', 'Hello there. I am as well. What items were you looking for specifically?üôÇ', 'Ok, could you tell me which item you need more and which one you need less?', 'Okay, what I need most is food because I need nutrients, could you tell me what is the least you need?üôÇ', 'Can you explain yourself better? What you need the least is food?', 'Awesome, I appreciate that. How does the water need look on your side?', 'Hm. Getting warmer. What do you need the most of? ', 'Okay friend. Which item do you need the most?', \"Hello! I'm so excited for this camping trip. What do you still need as your supplies?\", \"Good afternoon, how are doing today? Let's get this thing going. What items are you most interested?\", 'That works for me. Glad we could hammer out a deal. üôÇ What are you using all the firewood for?', 'Well hopefully it will be cooler up in the mountains. What supplies are you in need of?', 'I am a big eater. I tend to eat a lot throughout the day. You? üôÇ', 'Do you plan on having lots of campfires?', 'OK NO MENTION AND WHY YOU WANT FOOD', 'Do you have reasons for wanting food?', 'What is it that you really need on this camping trip?', \"I really need some more food. I only have the basics, and I'm afraid it's not going to be enough. What about yourself?\", 'It sure is..So how much food do you need for the trip? Do you need firewood to cook the food? Thank you for understanding my issues. üôÇ', 'I definitely need the food the most. I\\'m definitely not a \"hunter\", so if I were to run out, I\\'d be in pretty sad shape.

Well for my trip I'm most interesting in socializing so a great campfire a night would be great, I'd prefer not to boil water either so want extra of that too.

This isn't a problem we can't solve.  Are you in need of food too, then?\", 'I brought purification tablets so I can make do with rainwater or river water.

Do you need more?', 'Yeah, What did think about water? ', \"awesome! I love the rockies. So let's try and divy up our extra supplies then.

What are your prefernces? \", 'Uh oh. What are you preferences on supplies?', 'food, then water, then firewood, and yours?', 'Same here. My kids are really looking forward to this.

I am unfortunately sick and need the warmth of the fire and water to take my medication or I will die very soon', 'Oh, i see. How about you get 2 food 1 firewood and 1 water. I need the extra firewood to stay warm at night', \"Excellent, I would love to help you out.  We have plenty of water to spare.  I'd gladly give you 3 water in exchange for 3 firewood.\", \"I understand where you're coming from but I'm afraid that is not acceptable.

I would also request some extra water. \", 'It seems we both have a big need for firewood. üòÆ If you insist on 2 firewood, then I insist on getting 2 water AND 2 food along with 1 firewood.', 'Haha yup I had a feeling about that one. ;-) Yeah my wife has a bunch of crazy hikes planned so water is a must here too. What else?', \"Food of course, always snack more when relaxing.  Agree on the hiking.  Out in the woods, we won't have to wear masks!\", \"Hey, that's great. Good to hear definitely. I am also looking forward to build some campfires and enjoy some s'mores!\", 'Thats great! Would it be okay if I got 2 packages of firewood, and 1 each of the food and water?', \"You're right. I do not plan on hiking so you need more food than me. If I am correct, would I get 3 firewood/1 food while you get 3 water/2 food?\", 'Okay I will go for that and hope this satisfies you.', \"I appreciate your generosity üôÇ I think that bringing your axe would be a great idea! Also be sure to pack warm clothes and extra blankets! I'm sure we will both be fine\", 'Oh, I want you too as wellüòÆ', 'I understand. I would like one food and one water. How much wood do you want for that?', 'That is a problem. Does the medication require the use of fire or firewood as well?', \"Since carrying the extra would could make your dehydration worse, I'll take any firewood you don't want.

Yes, I can see how you would need firewood if you want to cook your food.  So, food is more important to you than water?', 'That sounds great. I probably need to go on a diet, but I like my food to much. LOL', 'Oh, that does change things a lot. Diabetes is a hard disease to have to deal with. So you want more firewood than water? And less food than water?', 'All the food is too much, I would need at least one package of the food for my group.

I meant to say that that sounds great! Yes, I can understand the need for extra water for the hike. With the size of my family, I could use a bit of extra food for our trip.', \"That's awesome! Since we have the basics, would you be willing to swap 3 packages of food for 3 packages of water?\", 'Absolutely understand. How does this deal sound: you will get 2 food, I will get 1. You will get 3 water, I will get 0. You will get 0 firewood, I will get 3.', \"Seeing as we both have a medical-necessity for the firewood, it's rather unfair that either one of us take ALL of the firewood.

That sounds pretty reasonable to me. I was going out with a bunch of my buddies. We like to hike a lot in the sun, so we need lots of water. How does it sound if i take all the food and water, but you get all the firewood?', 'Hmm, okay, that sounds reasonable. How does 3 water, 2 food and 1 firewood for me, and all the rest for you sound?', \"That sounds like a very reasonable deal, I understand how girls can get with their snacks haha. I'm okay with giving up all the firewood. You said you need at least some of the food, right?\", 'I do love sing alongs around the campfire. I usually go hiking and it requires a lot of energy and fuel. Maybe I can get additional food packages?', \"You'll definitely need some additional calories if you want to do extra hiking.  I will give you all the additional food if you give me all the additional firewood. \", 'Agreed.  Your fun trip could turn into something quite dangerous without that hydration.

I can give you all the water and we can split the fire wood. I need a least one firewood to make a fire for my son', \"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that ‚òπÔ∏è Let me ask about the food first then, would you be willing to give me the 3 packages of that?

Are you sure you need all three packages of firewood?', 'You can all the food if you need it.üôÇ', 'Same. Plus I am planning on keeping a fire long into the night.

How about you take 1 water and all the firewood?\", 'I‚Äôm sorry to hear that! If there are 3 packages of food please take 2 of them.

So I could spare some extra water. And I am pretty good at fishing, so I won't need much food either\", \"Oh wow that is quite a lot of hiking!

We will have a big group (about 10 people) so we are trying to have as much water as possible as well. If anyone gets dehydrated it'd be the end of the trip and hard to get everyone back to base.
